The first SuperFi

1- Decentralization: Supeer does not store any personal data of its users. A wallet on the blockchain is generated for users, and the wallet's private key serves as the user's password reset key. Web2 links is optional.

2- Regulation: Keys that unlock usersâ€™ locked messages form the foundation of the platform. Keys are not unlimited; participating users are requested to determine the number of keys and the sale price (free if desired).

3- Sustainable Revenue Model: Users host a unique advertising space on their profiles. Advertisers can post ads on these spaces within the decentralized network, setting their rewards as they wish.

4- Community-Centric Content Creation: Content creators can monetize their content, products, or services. By forming a community around their content, they can operate in a community-centric manner.

5- Fund Security and Hack Protection: Supeer does not accumulate any user funds but acts as a bridge between the user and the content creator by facilitating transactions to the specified extent.  

6- Community-Centric Tokenomics: Various badges and a special fund allocated to the community will be distributed via blockchain to reward the community. The tokenomics has reserved 40% for the community and airdrops.  

7- Easy Access and Community-Centric Reviews: The Peers system allows instant access to and experience of exclusive content (such as games, metaverse, programs with no installation required) and opportunity equality with community-centric ratings.
